TANSAM’s meteoric ascent to its status as a resource and beacon of hope has landed it as a top-3 finalist for this year’s Werner von Siemens (WvS) award “Siemens Matters” category under the entry “Non-Profit Collaboration: Embracing Industry 4.0.” The WvS Siemens Matters award is given for projects that provide access to technology and education and that sustain communities by:

Positively impacting society and the environment
Promoting responsible business practices
Going beyond our business activities and financial performance
The TANSAM center’s contributions and tremendous impact on the people of Tamil Nadu clearly merit its inclusion as a WvS award finalist. Other finalists in the category are “Creating a Home for Ukrainian Refugees,” which created a home in Poland for 160 refugees displaced by the war in Ukraine and “Empowered Communities: Digitalizing Aid with Mendix,” which developed low-code apps to help the Make A Wish organization overcome devastating setbacks caused by flooding in Germany and war in Ukraine.

While winning the award would bestow even more prestige, the real takeaway should be the good that the TANSAM center is creating. The same can be said for the other finalists in the Siemens Matters category.

This year, the WvS awards expanded from four to five categories. In addition to Siemens Matters, the other four categories include Customer Impact, Siemens Xcelerator, People, and Technology with Purpose.
