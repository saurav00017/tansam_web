        The hackathon event comprises industrial challenges: leather manufacturing (IoT) and Solar-Powered Drones. In the leather manufacturing sector, participants are tasked with addressing key issues such as integrating IoT for accurate area calculation, ensuring precise thickness measurements, synchronizing data across various production stages, and enabling real-time monitoring and analysis. The challenge requires the development of complex algorithms and seamless data integration systems to enhance production efficiency and quality control. Meanwhile, in the two-wheeler engine manufacturing hackathon, participants will utilize Plant Simulation software to model, simulate, and optimize the manufacturing process. They must accurately model machines, workstations, and material flows, then identify and implement improvements to enhance performance. Evaluation will be based on criteria including accuracy, completeness, performance, and the significance of optimizations.
